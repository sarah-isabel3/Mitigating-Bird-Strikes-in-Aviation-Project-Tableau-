# Mitigating Bird Strikes in Aviation – Tableau Dashboard Project

## Overview

Bird strikes in aviation pose safety, operational, and financial risks for airlines and airports worldwide. This Tableau project analyzes a comprehensive bird strike dataset, using interactive dashboards and visual storytelling to:
- Identify high-risk aircraft, airports, flight phases, and wildlife species
- Quantify operations disruption and costs
- Evaluate the effectiveness of pilot warnings and crew training
- Recommend strategies for prevention, conservation, and cost reduction
